## Work Flow
When you start a debug session now, OpenOCD will automatically do the following:
* Reset the device and let the boot ROM initialize the peripherals
* Load the FLASH plugin into the RAM
* Use the FLASH plugin to erase and program the memory (note that due to the way OpenOCD implements FLASH drivers, the plugin will get unloaded and loaded again between the erase and program operations).
* If the currently debugged project contained any RAM sections, OpenOCD would load them after unloading the FLASH plugin. In either case, the FLASH plugin will be completely unloaded before the application gets a chance to run and will never collide with it.
* Set the $PC register to the applicationâ€™s entry point and let it run. As a result, the application you are debugging will seamlessly get programmed into FLASH and you will be able to debug it.
